<p>The solar cell has revolutionized the energy demand problems of the present and so various new techniques have come into practice to have the highest efficiency and to get the cost-effective equipment. Mainly we use silicon in the solar cell to get the high efficiency but silicon is a very expensive material that’s why various new technologies introduced by the researchers to reduce the cost of solar cell and get the high efficiency. In the second generation of the photovoltaic solar cell, thin film technology was used. It is made by the deposition of thin films of photovoltaic materials on the substrate like glass, plastic or metal. To increase the efficiency and reduce the cost of the solar cell we use chalcogenide materials in thin film technology.</p>
